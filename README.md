# Predicting Congress

This project uses data from [here](https://www.govtrack.us/developers/data) to attempt to predict Congressional results

Currently, I am just exploring the data set. Here are some things that I am looking at right now
* What type of bills get passed?
* Who is likely to sign a certain bill?
* What type of bill would theoretically have the best chance of getting passed?
