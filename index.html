<h1 id="predicting-congress">Predicting Congress</h1>
<p>This project uses data from <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/developers/data">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress">here</a> to attempt to predict Congressional results.</p>
<p>As of 11/12/2015, we can predict whether or not a bill will be enacted into law with <strong>an accuracy of 97.21%</strong></p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<pre><code>$ python3 --version ; pandoc --version
Python 3.5.0a1
pandoc 1.15.0.6</code></pre>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>I recommend using the <code>bayesian_classifier</code> module, which contains both a normal version and a distilled version. They do the same thing, but run off two different datasets. The distilled version comes in this repo, you have to download the more bloated version (<code>~600MB</code>), by using the command provided when you try to run the file <code>bayesian_classifer/bayes_bills.py</code>.</p>
<p>You can run the distilled classifer based on bills via the following command. This will train a classifer based off of the bills processed during the 111th and 112th congress, with the goal of trying to predict the results of 113th congress.</p>
<p>The example output will be as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 bayesian_classifer/bayes_bills_distilled.py
Generating...
Predicting Outcomes for 113th congress...
Classified 10615 bills... Done!

Accuracy --&gt; 97.21149% for 10615 bills</code></pre>
<p>However, if you have run the classifier in the past, the program will not re-train the classifer, but rather load it from a file called <code>distilled_predictor.bayes</code></p>
<pre><code>$ python3 bayesian_classifer/bayes_bills_distilled.py
Loaded from file
Predicting Outcomes for 113th congress...
Classified 10615 bills... Done!

Accuracy --&gt; 97.21149% for 10615 bills</code></pre>
