  <summary>12/22/2009--Public Law.
Human Rights Enforcement Act of 2009 - Eliminates the Office of Special Investigations within the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ).

Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish, within 90 days after the enactment of this Act, a section within the Criminal Division of DOJ with responsibility for the enforcement of laws against suspected participants in serious human rights offenses; and (2) consult with the Secretaries of Homeland Security and State in taking appropriate legal action against such individuals. Defines "serious human rights offenses" to include genocide, torture, war crimes, and the use or recruitment of child soldiers.

Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) to punish a conspiracy to commit genocide in the same manner as completed act of genocide; (2) eliminate the limitation period for prosecuting crimes of genocide; and (3) include genocide and recruitment of child soldiers as predicates for the crime of providing material support to terrorists.

Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to broaden the basis for rendering aliens participating in genocide inadmissible.</summary>
