  <summary>5/19/2009--Introduced.
Ratepayer Recovery Act of 2009 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to cite conditions under which the President is authorized to make disaster assistance contributions for the repair, restoration, reconstruction, or replacement of private or investor-owned power transmission and distribution facilities damaged or destroyed by a major disaster.

Cites conditions for large in-lieu contributions to a private or investor-owned power facility in any case in which the owner determines that the public welfare would not best be served by repairing, restoring, reconstructing, or replacing the facility.</summary>
