Federal Judiciary Administrative Improvements Act of 2010 - Amends the federal judicial code to: (1) remove the power of certain active or retired federal judges to appoint U.S. magistrate judges; and (2) revise the statutory description of the District of North Dakota to eliminate the current four divisions, each of which holds court exclusively for specified counties.

Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) require court use of separate judgment and statement of reasons forms in the imposition of a criminal sentence; (2) require appropriate adaptation of pretrial services functions for juveniles; (3) modify the reporting schedule for criminal wiretap orders; and (4) increase the compensation thresholds triggering administrative review of compensation for non-counsel investigative, expert, or other services necessary for adequate representation of a person financially unable to obtain them.</summary>
