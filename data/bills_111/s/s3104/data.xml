  <summary>7/13/2010--Public Law.
(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on June 22, 2010. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) public access to accurate information is imperative for promoting government accountability and the protection of human rights; (2) Radio Free Asia (RFA) provides a vital voice to people in Asia; (3) some of the governments in Asia spend millions of dollars each year to jam RFA; and (4) Congress should provide additional and permanent funding for RFA.

Amends the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 to make permanent the authority of the Broadcasting Board of Governors to make grants to operate RFA.</summary>
