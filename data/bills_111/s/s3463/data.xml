  <summary>6/8/2010--Introduced.
Survivors Equality Act of 2010 - Revises the amount and apportionment of recovery by the personal representative of a decedent who brings a civil action in admiralty against the person or vessel responsible for the decedent's death when the death was caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default occurring on the high seas beyond three nautical miles from the U.S. shore.

Allows recovery of a fair compensation for nonpecuniary loss (as well as pecuniary loss, as under current law), plus damages for the decedent's pre-death pain and suffering. Defines "nonpecuniary loss" as loss of care, comfort, and companionship.</summary>
