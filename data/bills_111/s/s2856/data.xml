States that: (1) annual fishing level recommendations for fishery stocks in any given year under such Understandings may be exceeded as long as the fishing mortality level allows for progress toward rebuilding affected fish stocks; (2) the 10-year fishery rebuilding requirement shall not apply to stocks covered by such Understandings; and (3) this Act shall apply to fishing years beginning after April 30, 2010.</summary>
