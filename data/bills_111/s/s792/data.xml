  <summary>4/2/2009--Introduced.
Improvement of the National Program of Cancer Registries Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to revise requirements for statewide cancer registries and require the inclusion in such registries of information on: (1) the highest level of education attained by adults with cancer; (2) sources of payment by individuals for the costs of cancer diagnosis and treatment; and (3) the history of alcohol and tobacco use by individuals with cancer.

Requires the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to: (1) develop standards for collection of data elements for state cancer registries; (2) develop inter-operability and security standards for data exchange and integration between state cancer registries and any cancer registry and another federal registry for non-cancer diseases; and (3) provide a basic electronic collection tool to facilitate standardized data collection.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to facilitate coordination of the National Program of Cancer Registries with other federally-supported registry programs, including infectious disease registries, environmental disease registries, and other non-cancer, chronic disease registries.</summary>
