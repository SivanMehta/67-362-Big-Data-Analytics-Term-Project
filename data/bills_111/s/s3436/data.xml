Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to require the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to provide rebates for expenditures made by entities: (1) for the purchase and installation of a new electric motor that has a nominal full load efficiency that is not less than the nominal full load efficiency as defined in NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) Standards Publication MG 1-2006 for random wound motors rated 600 volts or lower or for form wound motors rated 5000 volts or lower; and (2) to replace an installed motor the specifications of which are to be established by the Secretary not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act.

Requires the Secretary to provide to the distributor of each such new electric motor purchased by an entity that received a rebate a payment to offset expenses relating to processing and motor core disposal costs.</summary>
