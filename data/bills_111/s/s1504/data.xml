  <summary>7/22/2009--Introduced.
Notice Pleading Restoration Act of 2009 - Prohibits a federal court from dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or because it is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably be required to frame a responsive pleading, except under the standards set forth by the Supreme Court in Conley v. Gibson (thus restoring the system of notice pleading previously used).</summary>
