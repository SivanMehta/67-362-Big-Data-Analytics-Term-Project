  <summary>3/26/2009--Introduced.
Outdoor Lighting Efficiency Act - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to include as "covered equipment" outdoor luminares and outdoor high light output lamps, as defined in this Act.

Specifies the lighting efficiency, lumen maintenance, and light level production capability required for each outdoor luminare manufactured on or after January 1 of 2011, 2013, and 2015. Requires the Secretary of Energy (DOE), by January 1, 2017, to issue a final rule amending such efficiency standards to establish standards at the maximum level that is technically feasible and economically justified.

Requires each outdoor high light output lamp manufactured on or after January 1, 2012, to have a lighting efficiency of at least 45 lumens per watt.

Sets forth provisions governing energy efficiency test procedures for such luminares and lamps.

Provides that state standards that are adopted on or before January 1, 2015, pursuant to a requirement to adopt efficiency standards for reducing outdoor lighting energy use enacted prior to January 31, 2008, shall not be preempted.</summary>
