  <summary>6/16/2009--Passed House amended.
Congressional Review Act Improvement Act - Eliminates a requirement that federal agencies must submit specified information about a rule to both Houses of Congress before such rule can take effect (thus requiring that the information be submitted to only the Comptroller General).

Requires the Comptroller General to submit to each House a weekly report containing a list of the rules received, including a notation identifying each major rule. Requires the Speaker of the House of Representatives to publish such report in the Congressional Record.</summary>
