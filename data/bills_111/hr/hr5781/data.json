and (2) such assessment to also characterize the risks of using potential commercial reusable suborbital flights.\n\nRequires the Administrator to designate an officer or employee of the Space Technology Program to act as the responsible official for the Commercial Reusable Suborbital Research Program in the Space Technology Program. Makes such designee responsible for the development of strategic plans related to the use of commercial reusable suborbital vehicles.\n\nEstablishes within the Space Technology Program the Commercial Reusable Suborbital Research Program to fund the development of payloads for scientific research, technology development, and education and to provide flight opportunities for those payloads to microgravity environments and suborbital altitudes. Permits such Research Program to fund engineering and integration demonstrations, proofs of concept, or experiments for commercial reusable vehicle flights.\n\nRequires the Administrator to submit annual reports to Congress describing the progress being made in the carrying out such Program.\n\nBars the Administrator from proceeding with a request for proposals, awarding any contract, commiting any U.S. government funds, or entering into any other agreement to provide a commercial reusable suborbital vehicle launch service for a NASA-sponsored payload or spaceflight participant until all indemnification and liability issues associated with the use of such systems by the U.S. government have been addressed and Congress has been provided with a report on the indemnification and liability provisions that are planned to be included in those contracts or agreements.\n\n(Sec. 907) Requires the Director of OSTP to study the need for a process for granting real-time, limited waivers of export control license restrictions or regulations that are necessary for U.S. government entities and contractors to enter into technical discussions and share technical data with foreign government entities and contractors to resolve anomalies that may: (1) threaten the safety of U.S. astronauts aboard cooperative crewed spacecraft such as the ISS; or (2) impair the operations of international civil research and other spacecraft that involve U.S. national interests.\n\n(Sec. 908) Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to allow retired commissioned military personnel to be appointed as the Administrator or Deputy Administrator of NASA.\n\n(Sec. 909) Directs the Administrator to designate a responsible official to coordinate NASA's NEO observation activities and interactions with other federal agencies and international entities on NEO surveys, defense, and efforts related to addressing any threats to the United States posed by NEOs.\n\nReaffirms policy with respect to the Near-Earth Object Survey and threats posed by NEOs.\n\nReiterates congressional support for the use of Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico for NASA-funded NEO-related activities. Ensures the availability of the Observatory's planetary radar to support such activities.\n\nProvides a specified amount from the funds authorized for planetary science in title I for FY2012-FY2013 for the support of grants for the investigation of innovative approaches for carrying out the congressionally mandated survey of NEOs equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter.\n\n(Sec. 910) Expresses the sense of the Congress that NASA endeavor to carry out the top recommendation in each mission area from the decadal survey.\n\n(Sec. 911) Reminds the legal staff of the Office of General Counsel of NASA that as government attorneys they have a special obligation to instruct NASA's staff on compliance with applicable federal law and regulations.\n\nRequires all NASA counsel to biennially receive ethics training in the legal obligations of government attorneys.\n\nProhibits the General Counsel of NASA from serving as NASA's designated ethics officer."
