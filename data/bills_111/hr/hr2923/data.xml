  <summary>10/12/2010--Public Law.
Combat Methamphetamine Enhancement Act of 2010 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to require each regulated retail seller of any scheduled listed chemical product at retail (i.e., a product used to make methamphetamine) to submit a self-certification of compliance with the requirements of such Act to the Attorney General.

Requires the Attorney General to: (1) establish criteria for certifications of mail order-distributors that are consistent with the criteria for the certifications of regulated sellers; and (2) develop a list of all self-certified individuals and make it publicly available on the website of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

Prohibits distributors of listed chemical products from selling such products to individuals not currently registered with the DEA.

Imposes civil penalties for negligent failure to self-certify as required by this Act.

Provides for compliance of the budgetary effects of this Act with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.</summary>
