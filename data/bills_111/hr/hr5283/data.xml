Help Haitian Adoptees Immediately to Integrate Act of 2010 or Help HAITI Act of 2010 - Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to adjust to permanent resident status an alien who: (1) was granted parole admission into the United States pursuant to the humanitarian parole policy for certain Haitian orphans announced on January 18, 2010, and suspended as to new applications on April 15, 2010; (2) is physically present in the United States; (3) is admissible as an immigrant; and (4) files an application for adjustment not later than three years after enactment of this Act.

Limits the number of such adjusted aliens to 1400.

Excepts such aliens from certain documentation requirements.
