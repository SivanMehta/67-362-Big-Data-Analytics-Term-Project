Requires notice of the public hearing to have been printed in the appropriate local newspaper at least 15 days before the hearing.\n\nRequires further that, if such earmark request is for public improvement purposes, the local government entity with jurisdiction over the requested improvement has passed a resolution in support of the earmark request or written a binding official communication in its support.\n\nLimits the amount of appropriated funds for the project to 50% of its total cost. Prohibits an earmark from funding any administrative costs.\n\nRequires the requesting Member to have posted the earmark request on his or her public website, including the name and address of the intended recipient or, if there is no specifically intended recipient, the intended location of the activity, the earmark's purpose, and the 30-day public hearing notice.\n\nAmends Rule X (Organization of Committees) to require any subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations to hold a hearing on all requested earmarks to be included in a measure or any accompanying report before it approves such legislation. Requires a 14-day advance public notice of the hearing on the committee website.\n\nRequires the Member requesting an earmark to testify in its support at the applicable subcommittee hearing."
