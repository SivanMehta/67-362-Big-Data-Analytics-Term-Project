Public Corruption Elimination Act of 2010 - Denies federal retirement benefits to an individual (or his or her survivor or beneficiary) who has been convicted of a felony under federal or state law that involves bribery, graft, misappropriation of public funds or property, or conflicts of interest, that occurred in connection with the individual's service as an employee, and that occurs after this Act's enactment.

Prohibits an individual who is under indictment for such offense from being paid an annuity or retired pay if the individual willfully remains outside the United States for more than one year with knowledge of the indictment or charges.

Prohibits the computation and inclusion of interest on a refund of such an individual's retirement contributions for the period after the conviction.

Authorizes restoration of annuity or retired pay if an individual who was convicted of an offense against state law under this Act is pardoned by the governor.</summary>
