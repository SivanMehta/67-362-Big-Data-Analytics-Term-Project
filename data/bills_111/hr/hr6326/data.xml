Fair and Impartial Recruitment Act of 2010 - Directs the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration [TSA]) to: (1) issue regulations to establish a waiver process to allow an air carrier, foreign air carrier, airport operator, or government to hire an individual who has been disqualified for employment for a position as an airport security screener or in which an individual has unescorted access to a sterile airport area because of a conviction of a specified crime; and (2) establish an appeals process for a disqualified individual that includes notice and an opportunity for a hearing before an impartial third party. Requires the Assistant Secretary to issue a waiver to an individual: (1) who, based on certain criteria, does not pose a terrorism risk; and (2) without regard to whether that individual would otherwise be disqualified by reason of a felony conviction, if the employer establishes acceptable alternate security arrangements.</summary>
