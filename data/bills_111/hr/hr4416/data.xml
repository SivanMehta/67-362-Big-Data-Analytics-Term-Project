Great Ape Conservation Reauthorization Amendments Act of 2010 - Amends the Great Ape Conservation Act of 2000 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to award a multiyear grant to an eligible person to implement a great ape conservation project that the person demonstrates is an effective, long-term conservation strategy for great apes and their habitats.

Authorizes the Secretary to implement a program of awards to acknowledge outstanding achievement in great ape conservation, to enhance great ape conservation, and to demonstrate the indebtedness of the world to the commitment made by individuals and local communities to protect and conserve populations of great apes.

Requires the Secretary to convene a panel of experts to identify the greatest needs and priorities for the conservation of great apes within a year of this Act's enactment and every five years thereafter (current law authorizes the Secretary to convene a panel to consider the greatest conservation needs every two years). Requires the panel to include representatives from foreign range states with expertise in great ape conservation and to consider relevant great ape conservation plans or strategies, including scientific research and findings related to: (1) conservation needs and priorities of great apes; (2) regional or species-specific action plans or strategies; (3) applicable strategies developed or initiated by the Secretary; and (4) any other applicable conservation plan or strategy.

Authorizes the Secretary to pay expenses of convening and facilitating meetings of the panel.

Authorizes appropriations for the Great Ape Conservation Fund for FY2011-FY2015.</summary>
