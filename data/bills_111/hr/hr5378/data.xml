United Arab Emirates Human Rights Accountability Act of 2010 - Makes an alien who is a member of the royal families of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and who is an officer or employee of the UAE government ineligible to receive a U.S. entry visa and ineligible for U.S. admission until the Secretary of State certifies to Congress that: (1) the government of the UAE has established an independent governmental entity to investigate any such individual; and (2) Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al-Nahyan has been tried in accordance with international legal norms and human rights standards for specified offenses. Authorizes the Secretary to waive such prohibition for reasons of national interest.

Describes such offense as any offense under UAE law: (1) that was committed in connection with the assault on Mohammed Shah Poor; and (2) for which Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al-Nahyan has not been tried.

Directs the Secretary to revoke the nonimmigrant visa or other documentation of any alien who is rendered ineligible for such visa or documentation under the terms of this Act.</summary>
