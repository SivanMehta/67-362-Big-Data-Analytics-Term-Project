Requires the state to create a mechanism through which providers or suppliers that do not otherwise have Medicaid provider agreements with the state can bill the state for Medicare cost-sharing for QMBs.\n\nRequires each state to: (1) identify those individuals who are Medicaid-eligible for Medicare cost-sharing and who are enrolled with a MedicareAdvantage (MA) plan; and (2) provide for Medicaid payment with respect to such individuals for the Medicare cost-sharing to which they are entitled.\n\nRequires the award of grants to: (1) states for outreach regarding Medicare enrollment assistance and benefit availability; and (2) Aging and Disability Resource Centers.\n\nMakes the date of the electronic transmission of low income subsidy (LIS) program data from the Commissioner of Social Security to the state Medicaid agency the date of filing of the application for MSP benefits\n\nRequires a state Medicaid plan to provide that the state enters into a modification of a Medicaid agreement with the Secretary to provide for enrollment in (buy-in to) the Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance) program by QMBs who are uninsured elderly individuals not otherwise eligible for hospital insurance benefits.\n\nRequires states to: (1) make MSP applications available on the Internet; and (2) allow individuals to specify a preferred language other than English for subsequent communication.\n\nRequires a state Medicaid plan to provide that the state coordinates with the state agency that administers the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) benefits under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to ensure that individuals applying for Medicaid have the opportunity to apply for, establish eligibility for, and, if eligible, receive SNAP program benefits.\n\nRepeals payment limitations on Medicare cost-sharing."
