Russell National School Lunch Act with respect to the summer food service programs for children in service institutions (e.g., schools and summer camps).\n\nRevises the condition limiting eligibility to institutions conducting a regularly scheduled food service for children from areas in which poor economic conditions exist (i.e., where at least 50% of the children meet eligibility requirements for certain free or reduced price school meals.)\n\nEliminates the special 2005 and 2006 exemption from this requirement for rural areas in Pennsylvania which lowers the threshold eligibility to areas where at least 40% of the children meet eligibility requirements for free or reduced price school meals.\n\nApplies such 40% threshold to rural areas of all states and makes it permanent."
