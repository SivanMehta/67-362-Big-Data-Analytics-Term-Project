    "text": "Keeping America's Food Safe Act of 2009 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require: (1) certification of any food safety laboratory or a sampling service that is analyzing, testing, or collecting samples of imported food; and (2) such laboratories or services to submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the results of all tests conducted on behalf of an importer.\n\nSets forth civil penalties for: (1) an importer that knowingly engages in the falsification of test results submitted to the Secretary; and (2) a laboratory or service that knowingly submits false test results to the Secretary.\n\nRequires the Secretary to establish a certification program to ensure that imported food meets the food safety standards applied to food produced in the United States.\n\nProhibits food from being permitted entry into the United States from a foreign facility in a foreign country unless there are certifications from the facility and country, except if the certification is not needed for the Secretary's evaluation of whether the facility's or country's standards are at least equivalent to standards applicable to food produced in the United States.\n\nSets forth certification requirements for foreign countries.\n\nRequires the Secretary to develop and maintain websites on: (1) food safety issues; and (2) the development of school curricula regarding food safety issues.\n\nEstablishes whistle-blower's protections.\n\nRevises the definition of \"responsible party\" to include an establishment that analyzes or tests samples of food for consumption in the United to States to ensure its safety. Requires a responsible party to notify the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within 24 hours about test results that suggest that an article of food is reportable food, irrespective of whether the party subsequently determines that such article isn't reportable food.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to request and, in the absence of voluntary compliance, to order an establishment to recall food that has been distributed and that presents a risk of illness, injury, or gross consumer deception when necessary to protect the public health."
